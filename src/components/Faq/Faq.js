            <h2 className="font-semibold ">â€‹May I send my book to you?</h2>
            <p>
              Yes. We recommend getting a rough estimate by phone first. If you
              decide to ship your book please include your name, phone number,
              address, and email address. When we receive your book we will call
              with an estimate.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2 className="font-semibold ">What is your process?</h2>
            <p>
              We are happy to provide a rough estimate by phone or email. If you
              decide to bring or ship your book to us we will offer an exact
              estimate after we have looked over it. We do ask for a 50% deposit
              to schedule the work. The balance is due within 30 days of
              completion.
